Varuna can be used with NVIDIA Megatron's pytorch models. Here we've made the modifications for GPT-2 training.
This example is built on this commit of https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM: 28cd66e1a2d01ada962c356f4a23961cbf4c00b3
The diff file megatron.patch in this folder can be applied to this commit to get a working version of 
Megatron-LM GPT-2 with Varuna.
